# //replacing and modifying one_column based on the value of another column. For this in 1 we are subsetting value of acct_cur ( value are in euro) and in 
step 2 we are replacing the of acct_amount column ( the euro value ) to converted dollar value. in step 3 changing the labels.

# 1.  Find values of acct_cur that are equal to 'euro'
acct_eu = banking['acct_cur'] == 'euro'

# 2. Convert acct_amount where it is in euro to dollars
banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_amount'] = banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_amount'] * 1.1 

# 3. Unify acct_cur column by changing 'euro' values to 'dollar'
banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_cur'] = 'dollar'

# Assert that only dollar currency remains
assert banking['acct_cur'].unique() == 'dollar'
